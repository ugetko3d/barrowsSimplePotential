# BarrowsSimplePotential
A barrows potential plugin that will display which monsters to kill to get maximum runes.
It's very simple, it will basically tell you to kill 1x skeleton, 1x bloodworm, and 2x crypt spiders in the tunnels beneath the crypts.
The plugin assumes that you also kill all 6 barrows brothers.
This will give a total of 880 potential points, or 88.0%, which will have the best chance of giving maximum amount of runes.
